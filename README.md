Self-supervised Low Light Image Enhancement and Denoising:[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349683113_Self-supervised_Low_Light_Image_Enhancement_and_Denoising),[Supplementary Material](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349683003_Self-supervised_Low_Light_Image_Enhancement_and_Denoising_Supplementary_Material)

Adding denoise to the previous work: Since the previous work was rejected for no denoise part, we creat a denoise method for self-supervised image enhancement networks ！We are revising the previous paper.

method now:

method2 now:

method1 now:

And the contranst can be changed by any contrast enhancement method, the same as our [recent work](https://github.com/hitzhangyu/image-enhancement-with-denoise) ！
